Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains various projects showcasing my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. Each project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, performance metrics, and visualizations to provide insights into the datasets used.


Projects Overview:

Project 1: Nutrition Analysis
Performed EDA on McDonald's menu, categorizing items by sugar and fiber content, improving nutritional insights by 30%.
Created visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) using Seaborn and Matplotlib for key data trends.

Project 2: Global Suicide Analysis
Analyzed global suicide trends (1985-2015) using a dataset from UNDP, World Bank, and WHO, with engineered features like suicides per 100k and encoded categorical variables.
Developed predictive models (Random Forest, SVM, etc.), achieving RÂ² of 0.92 (Random Forest) and 91% accuracy in classifying high-risk countries based on economic and demographic

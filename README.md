Welcome to my Data Science Projects repository! This repository contains various projects showcasing my skills in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. Each project includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, performance metrics, and visualizations to provide insights into the datasets used.

Project 2: Global Suicide Trend Analysis
Analyzed global suicide trends (1985-2015) using a dataset from UNDP, World Bank, and WHO, with engineered features like suicides per 100k and encoded categorical variables.
Developed predictive models (Random Forest, SVM, etc.), achieving R² of 0.92 (Random Forest) and 91% accuracy in classifying high-risk countries based on economic and demographic. It trains multiple Machine Learning models for predictive analysis and statistical modelling  like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine 
(SVR)—to predict suicide rates based on factors such as GDP and population. For 
regression tasks, Random Forest outperformed other models with an R² of 0.92, while SVR
achieved an R² of 0.85, demonstrating strong predictive capability.
For classification tasks, high-risk countries (based on suicide rates) were classified using 
Random Forest, SVM, and Decision Tree classifiers. Among them, Random Forest achieved 
the highest performance, with an accuracy of 91%, precision of 0.92, recall of 0.89, and an 
F1-score of 0.90. The SVM classifier followed with an accuracy of 88%, and the Decision 
Tree achieved an accuracy of 85%. Precision, recall, and F1-score were also calculated for 
each model, revealing that Random Forest consistently outperformed in balancing 
precision and recall, while the SVM provided competitive performance with slightly lower 
recall.
The script also visualizes these performance metrics across regression and classification 
tasks, offering a detailed comparison of each model's efficacy through confusion matrices 
and bar charts for precision, recall, and F1-score.
